Lead:
Today´s appearance of Conil is one of modern white-washed buildings 
cascading down to the extensive beaches which are the main draw for the visitor. But, there 
is more, much more… Its origin as a fishing village, in the lower Middle Ages, is not hard 
to see. In 1983, Conil was declared a site of historical importance; with good reason 
considering its historical and cultural heritage.

Text:

Viewing the town´s surroundings, such as from the 
Torre de Guzmán, (link – Torre de Guzmán) reveals the unique 
location of Conil. It is situated both between two oceans and between 
two continents; the Mediterranean and the Atlantic Oceans, and the continents 
of old Europe and the even older Africa, respectively. Situated near the mythical 
Pillars of Hercules (the real rock outcrops of Jebel Musa in Morocco and Gibraltar), Conil´s 
geographical position in the classical world has meant that the town has seen 
succeeding civilisations come and go. Although the current town´s origins lie in 
he Medieval era during the Reconquista (the Christian re-occupation of the 
Iberian Peninsula), the result is that Conil has been part of the civilised 
western world for over 3,000 years, and even before as part of little known 
Tarsessus and possibly a satellite settlement of the legendary Atlantisi. Consequently, a 
closer look at Conil reveals a fascinating and long history.
