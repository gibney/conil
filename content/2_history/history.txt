Today´s appearance of Conil is one of modern white-washed buildings 
cascading down to the extensive beaches which are the main draw for the visitor. But, there 
is more, much more… Its origin as a fishing village, in the lower Middle Ages, is not hard 
to see. In 1983, Conil was declared a site of historical importance; with good reason 
considering its historical and cultural heritage.
