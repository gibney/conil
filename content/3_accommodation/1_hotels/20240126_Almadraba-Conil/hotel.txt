Intro:

A restored big house from the 18th century which is now used as a hotel. It has 
17 rooms set around two typical Andalusian patios. It's pretty basic looking from the outside. However, it is lovely when you go inside.

Description:

Boutique Hotel, located in the old part of Conil and just a 250 meters from 
Los Bateles beach. Its privileged situation, in the surroundings of Guzman Tower, Santa 
Catalina Church and La Chanca, lets you enjoy to the real Conil on foot. We can forget 
about the car and enjoy its gastronomy, its monuments and mainly its inhabitants.
