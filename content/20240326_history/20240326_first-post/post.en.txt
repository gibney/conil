Its origin as a fishing village, in the lower Middle Ages, is not hard to see. In 1983, Conil was declared a site of historical importance; with good reason considering its historical and cultural heritage.   


Viewing the town´s surroundings, such as from the Torre de Guzmán, (link – Torre de Guzmán) reveals the unique location of Conil. It is situated both between two oceans and between two continents; the Mediterranean and the Atlantic Oceans, and the continents of old Europe and the even older Africa, respectively. Situated near the mythical Pillars of Hercules (the real rock outcrops of Jebel Musa in Morocco and Gibraltar), Conil´s geographical position in the classical world has meant that the town has seen succeeding civilisations come and go.    
Although the current town´s origins lie in the Medieval era during the Reconquista (the Christian re-occupation of the Iberian Peninsula), the result is that Conil has been part of the civilised western world for over 3,000 years, and even before as part of little known Tarsessus and possibly a satellite settlement of the legendary Atlantis [I]. Consequently, a closer look at Conil reveals a fascinating and long history.
