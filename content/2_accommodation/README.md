##Â Naming Convention

Accommodation is prefixed with the date that the property was added.
e.g. 20240121_Tres-Piedras
Tres Piedras was added to the site on 24th Jan 2024

Text in the file name should be seperated by a hyphon. SEO sees the hyphon as a space. so searching for Tres Piedras will result in Tres-Piedras.
